       Final Prompt (For Any Language)
You are an expert in software documentation. I will provide you with:

The cleaned directory structure of a project (only relevant files and folders).
The main source code files in one or more programming languages.
Your task is to:

Detect the programming language(s) used in the project.
Use best practices for documentation in each detected language.
Generate a structured and professional README.md file.
The README should include:

Title: A short, descriptive title of the project.
Description: A brief overview of what the project does.
Installation: Steps to install dependencies (if applicable).
Usage: Instructions on how to use the project, including input and expected output.
Directory Structure: A formatted view of the cleaned project structure, with explanations of key files.
Features: A list of key functionalities.
Example Output: A sample output from the program.
Customization: How users can modify or extend the project.
Language-Specific Documentation:
If it's Python ‚Üí Include docstrings and module descriptions.
If it's JavaScript/TypeScript ‚Üí Include JSDoc comments.
If it's C/C++ ‚Üí Include Doxygen-style documentation.
If it's Java ‚Üí Include Javadoc-style documentation.
If it's another language ‚Üí Use best practices for that language.
License: If applicable, include a license section.
Cleaned Project Directory Structure (Only Relevant Files & Folders):

csharp
Copy code
{tree_structure}
Main Source Code Files:

csharp
Copy code
{contents}
‚ö†Ô∏è Note: The directory structure has already been cleaned‚Äîunnecessary files and folders have been removed. Please focus only on relevant parts.

Now, generate a professional README.md file based on this information, using proper documentation conventions for each detected programming language.

Why This Works Well:
‚úÖ Auto-detects languages and applies the right documentation style.
‚úÖ Works for any project, whether Python, JavaScript, C++, Java, Go, Rust, etc.
‚úÖ Ensures best practices are used for each language.

Would you like me to generate a README for a specific project using this approach? üöÄ,""",
